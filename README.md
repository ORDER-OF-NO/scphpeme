# SCpHpEME

just run ./repl.php and you should have the repl to play with. 

I tried to do a straight port of the norvig python version but using "best practice" and idiomatic php e.g. braces when ever there is an if block etc. A Lambda class was added so that to_string could give a meaningful response other than an exception indicating that a closure can not be a string. 

## TODO
make all tests pass (including TCO)

It would be nice to add readline support for the repl.

allow multi-line support for repl so you can enter longer expressions.
