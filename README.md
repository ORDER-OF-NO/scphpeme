# SCpHpEME

just run ./repl.php and you should have the repl to play with. 

I tried to do a straight port of the norvig python version but using "best practice" and idiomatic php e.g. braces when ever there is an if block etc. A Lambda class was added so that to_string could give a meaningful response other than an exception indicating that a closure can not be a string. 

## TODO
make all tests pass (including TCO)

It would be nice to add readline support for the repl.

allow multi-line support for repl so you can enter longer expressions.

I just heard the news that john mccarthy passed away early this morning. 1927 - 2011. 
It is literally impossible for me to put into words the impact his contribution to science
has made on my life. Lisp has expanded my mind, my horizons and brought me deeper undestanding
of language, philosophy, and art.
